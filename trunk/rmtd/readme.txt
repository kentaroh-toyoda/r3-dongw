main.c is the original RMTD algorithm from JT Hu

main.cpp simply corrects errors in main.c when compiling. mainly type conversion in main.c. We should use cpp because main.c allocates vars after some statements which does not strictly conform to C standards.

rmtd.c is my improved RMTD algorithm in R2
